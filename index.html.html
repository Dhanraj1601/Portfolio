    <h3>Exploring My Journey in 3D Animation and Web Development</h3>
    <p>
        Hey there! I'm Dhanraj, a tech and design enthusiast who's on an exciting journey into the world of web development, 3D animation, and programming. <br>
        As a BCA student, I am diving deep into learning HTML, CSS, and C programming, but what really drives me is my passion for creating visually compelling digital art and animations.<br>
        One of my recent projects was a 3D car animation in Blender, where I experimented with realistic motion and textures to bring the model to life. I’ve also worked on a Deadpool 3 fan animation and a horror-themed clip, trying out different lighting techniques and camera angles to create the perfect suspenseful atmosphere.<br>
        Currently, I'm tackling fluid simulations to understand realistic water physics, and each day brings a new set of challenges and discoveries.
        For me, animation and coding aren’t just technical skills—they’re tools for storytelling. With each project, I aim to capture an idea, a mood, or a moment, blending creativity with technical knowledge. This portfolio is my space to document these projects, share insights, and continue growing my skills. I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me next!<br><br>

        Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to explore my projects. I hope they inspire you as much as they inspire me to create!
